  "readme": "The `rest` module for OAE.\n\nThis is a stand-alone module that can be used to communicate with a live OAE instance through its REST endpoints.\n\n### Releasing\n\nThis module is versioned the same as the [Hilary](https://github.com/oaeproject/Hilary) project. When a new version of Hilary is released, a matching version of this module should be released. To keep the versions in sync, we do the following:\n\n* Every release is post-fixed with `-N` starting from `-1`. Any `<hilary version>-N` release of this module will work with `<hilary version>` of Hilary. The `-N` postfix is only for maintenance things such as updating build scripts or critical package.json scripts\n* Whenever there is a new Hilary release, we release a compatible version of this module with the same version\n\nTo do that, we use the [grunt-release](https://github.com/geddski/grunt-release) plugin, however we do some additional acrobatics to follow the above process:\n\n1. To update just the pre-release version of this module, run: `grunt release-version:prerelease`\n2. To do a patch-version release of this module, run: `grunt release-version:patch`\n3. To do a minor-version release of this module, run: `grunt release-version:minor`\n4. To do a major-version release of this module, run: `grunt release-version:major`\n\nTherefore if you are on version `4.4.0-3` and you need to upgrade the module for a `5.0.0` release of Hilary, you run the following:\n\n`grunt release-version:major`, and that will release and publish version `5.0.0-1` of this module to NPM.",
